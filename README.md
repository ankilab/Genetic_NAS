Welcome to the Genetic_NAS repository, the home of Yipeng Sun's Master's Thesis project. This project explores the use of genetic algorithms to search for adaptable models specifically designed for Edge TPU. We aim to leverage the capabilities of the Edge TPU to enhance inference speed while maintaining a high level of accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Overview

The core goal of Genetic_NAS is to harness the power of genetic algorithms to find optimal models for image classification that can effectively utilize the capabilities of the Edge TPU. The aim is to boost inference speed without compromising on the accuracy of predictions.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this project, you should have:

- Familiarity with Python 3.9 and above
- Basic understanding of neural networks
- Some knowledge about genetic algorithms

## Environment and Installation

This project is developed in Python 3.9 environment with TensorFlow 2.11 being the major library used. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machineï¼š
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/sypsyp97/Genetic_NAS.git
cd Genetic_NAS
```
2. Set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the main source code for the project and utility scripts that aid in various tasks throughout the project.
- `get_datasets/`: This directory includes scripts for data acquisition.
- `tf_flower_example.py`: A Python script that is used for testing the application with the TensorFlow Flowers dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies the libraries and their respective versions required for this project.
- `rst_generator.py`: A script used to generate reStructuredText (.rst) files for use with the Sphinx documentation generator.


## Usage Example

Here's an example of how you can use the `start_evolution` function to initiate the process of NAS:

```python
from src.Evolutionary_Algorithm import start_evolution

population_array, max_fitness_history, average_fitness_history, best_models_arrays = start_evolution(
        train_ds=train_dataset,
        val_ds=val_dataset,
        test_ds=test_dataset,
        generations=4,
        population=20,
        num_classes=5,
        epochs=30,
        time=formatted_date
    )
```

You can also easily start the NAS process by running the `tf_flower_example.py` script. This script has been designed to make running the NAS process simpler by predefining certain parameters and steps.
```bash
python tf_flower_example.py
```

## Documentation

The detailed documentation for the functions used in this project is available [online](https://sypsyp97.github.io/Genetic_NAS/).

Alternatively, you can clone the `gh-pages` branch of this repository to view the documentation offline:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the command `git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/sypsyp97/Genetic_NAS.git`. This will clone only the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory using `cd Genetic_NAS`.
4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the documentation.
